## Track your items application

This application is used to track the amounts your owned items are being used. You can track whatever item you wish and compare the usages of several items to conclude necessary / unnecessary stuff. Demo running in https://manage-items.herokuapp.com/

## Current development status: on hold

#### Still to come:
  - A user should see an item's use history
  - A user should be able to compare the histories of several items
  - A user should be able to import distance infromation through common APIs (such as Strava, SportsRunner, PolarFlow etc) and point it to selected item(s).
